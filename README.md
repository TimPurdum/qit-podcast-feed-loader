This is the part of the product that is responsible for importing the data.

It loads podcast feed urls from a file, normalizes them, and then updates them in a search engine. Currently only supports Azure Search.

### Running with Docker

```
# test docker enviroment bindings before creating containers
docker-compose config

# start local development
docker-compose up -d

# start regular docker
docker-compose build && docker-compose up [ OPTIONAL ] -d (if console is not needed)  
```

Command to stop container:

```;bash
# to stop
docker-compose stop
```

### Running without Docker

We recommend you run this with Docker, but you can also do things the old fashioned way:

```;bash
# Set environment variables (see below)
cd app
npm install
npm start
```

### Settings

There are a couple environment settings you can set in order to actually update a search engine. Currently the only supported engine is Azure.

You can run the project without these settings. It won't actually update anything, but it's a good test.

```;bash
SEARCH_PROVIDER="Azure"
AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME=â€œpodcasts"
AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT="https://podcasts.search.windows.net"
AZURE_SEARCH_ADMIN_API_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_HERE"
AZURE_SEARCH_API_VERSION="2017-11-11-Preview"
SEARCH_OLDEST_INDEX_DATE='2018-12-29'
```
